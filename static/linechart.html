            This multiline chart shows the low birth weights relative to other surrounding counties, both the states of Oregon and 
            Washington as a whole, and also in relation to the United States as a whole. Mouse over the graph for specific numbers by year.
          </p>
          <h1>Observations</h1>
          <p>
            Some immediate observations as the graph loads with all the data graphed is that Skamania county is highly variable, 
            having the lowest minimum and highest maximum in the dataset. A potential answer for this swing can easily be ascribed 
            to Skamania having the lowest population in comparison to the rest of the data (assuming we didn't have access to the underlying datasets for each of these aggregates, a simple internet search shows this to
            be the case). More datapoints, in this case low birthweight babies, give for larger variation, while more datapoints give a smoother line from year to year.
            Hence why the United States line is the smoothest of all the lines on this graph. Can you think of a potential other reason why 
            the lines might vary from year to year more wildly that is not encompassed in population?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you focus in on just the Washington, Oregon, and United States lines (by clicking the legend), you can immediately notice
            a few things:
            <ul>
              <li>Oregon and Washington both are significantly lower than the US as a whole.</li>
              <li>Though Oregon and Washington are both lower than the US, they do roughly seem to mirror the US trend.</li>
              <li>There is a peak in the US data in 2006 that is also reflected in the Oregon data, but not Washington.</li>
              <li>Though there is some variation between Washington and Oregon, a noticable trend is seen as they both trend up together.</li>              
            </ul>
            What could account for the peak and spike in 2006 in the US and Oregon data but not in Washington? Why would Washington and Oregon follow each other in such a visually correlated way? How 
            could we determine if the factors involved in both states are mostly the same?
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you see anything that interests you in this data as presented? Are there any more questions we should ask of this graph?
