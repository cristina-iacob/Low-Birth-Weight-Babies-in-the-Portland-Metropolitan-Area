        <h2>Percentage of Low Birth Weight Babies in the Portland Metropolitan Area, 1998-2015</h2>
      </div>

      <!-- Left Side In-Depth Description -->
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Using three visualizations: a line chart, a choropleth with draggable timeline, and an error bar bar chart,
          we explore the percentages of babies born with low birth weights in the Portland Metropolitan Area. We begin
          with a line chart for an overall view of US, state and county data, then we move onto a choropleth for a
          closer look at county changes over time, and we end with an error bar bar chart for a deeper view of each
          county.</p>
        <h3>The Importance of the Data</h3>
        <p>For this study, low birth weights were defined as any weight less than 2,500 grams (about 5.51 pounds).
          According to our source data: <i>"Babies with low birth weights face increased risks of infection, impaired
            development, developmental delays, and higher rates of infant death."</i> With multiple factors that can
          influence the occurrence of babies born with low birth weights, exploring this data set hopefully helps to
          narrow the scope of specific counties with higher than average, low birth weight percentages.</p>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this presentation is to explore the aggregated low birth weight data by county, state, and
          country to answer one main question: In what way is this data useful? We embark on an exploration to both 
          observe trends and ask questions of those observations to determine if some of the observations can be 
          explained by simple or obvious reasons, or if the observations are telling us something new and insightful. 
          Another reason for exploration of the data is also to see if the data shows where knowledge is lacking and 
          can launch new inqueries into other datasets that may help suss out a more nuanced understanding of the 
          specific causes of low birth weight surrounding the Portland Metropolitan area.
        </p>
        <h5>Observations and Questions</h5>
        <p>As you progress through the website using the links at the top or the pictures of the graphs on the side,
           we will state some observations based on the charts and graphs and pose some questions. If you have questions or observations of your 
           own, please feel free to explore on you own.

        <h6>Data and Sourcing</h6>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <a href="https://opendata.imspdx.org/dataset/low-birth-weight-babies"><li>NODE</li></a>
            <a href="http://portlandpulse.org/low_birth_weight_babies"><li>Greater Portland Pulse</li></a>

          </ul>
          The data used for this project was retrieved from the NODE website (first list item above), though that 
          website sourced Greater Portland Pulse as the location of the datasets provided. The data was downloaded in csv 
          format, then uploaded to a Postgres SQL database using Jupyter Notebook. The data is retrieved from the database 
          using Flask, returning the data in JSON format. Another source of general low birth weight information is 
          here:
